This module provides a playlist, audio files, and liner notes for the album.

Ghosts I-IV is an experimental, instrumental album of atmospheric moods that depict visual scenes with ambient audio. Some tracks are quiet and contemplative while others are moodier or edgier. It can be used with great effect in an RPG game, especially in darker horror, science-fiction, dystopian, or post-apocalyptic settings.
